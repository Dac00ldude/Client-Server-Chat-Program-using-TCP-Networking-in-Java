# Client-Server-Chat-Program-using-TCP-Networking-in-Java
  The program allows two or more users to communicate with each other through a chat interface. It uses TCP protocol for establishing a reliable communication channel between the client and the server.
  The server side is responsible for handling incoming connections from clients, accepting and processing incoming messages, and broadcasting messages to all connected clients. The server listens on a specific port and accepts incoming connections from multiple clients.
  The client side is responsible for establishing a connection with the server, sending and receiving messages to and from the server, and displaying the messages in a user-friendly interface. The client connects to the server by specifying the server's IP address and port number.
  The program is written in Java and can be compiled and executed using the command line. The code uses various Java networking classes such as Socket, ServerSocket, and InetAddress to establish and manage the network connections.
